# Unstandard Library for Python

Have you ever written code that you used in more than one project? Me too.

This is a compilation of highly-reusable code for Python.


# Organization

This library includes code with no dependencies and code with dependencies. Only the no-dependency code will be imported by default. Each collection of code with a specific dependency is bundled under its own module (such as Django-specific code).

We value simplicity and elegance over robustness and optimization. This library should serve as a good foundation for your own application-specific code instead of a complete framework. In other words, it is preferred to have a 2-line function that covers 80% of use cases than a 20-line function that covers 100% of the use cases.


# Highlights

* TODO: List some of the most useful functions here.
